# AlphaFold-3---IL-8-Protein-Binding-Optimization
This project leverages AlphaFold 3, Google Cloud, and protein interaction simulation to search for proteins that bind strongly to IL-8 (human interleukin factor). The goal is to generate and optimize protein sequences, predict their 3D structures, and simulate their interactions with IL-8.
